This app is a pomodoro-ish timer that is designed to better integrate into your workday.

Instead of focusing for X minutes, it lets you focus until the next half hour.

This way, you can fit focus sessions in between meetings, and start them ad-hoc without having to worry that they might overlap with your next meeting.
